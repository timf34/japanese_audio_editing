# japanese_audio_editing

### TODO 

This codebase was primarily for a quick job, however when I come 
back to it I should clean things up and refactor it towards OOB. 
Its all pretty small, and relatively clean, however had some issues
managing the passing of paths -> _fix up dir path related code!_

_A reminder:_ The job was helping Omar with removing the silence
on either end of the audio files, and then converting and 
compressing the files.
